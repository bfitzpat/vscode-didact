# Creating and Publishing a New Didact Tutorial

The following steps illustrate two things. First, you can use them to easily create a new Didact tutorial and register it in your workspace. Second, you can see how to add a time estimate to each step along the way so that it appears in the tooltip for the registered tutorial in the `Didact Tutorials` view.

## Create a new Didact File {time=5}

## Add a Didact Link {time=5}

## Register New Tutorial {time=2}

## Done!
