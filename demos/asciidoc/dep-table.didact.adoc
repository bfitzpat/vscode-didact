# Example with a Table of Dependencies

Though many choose to put dependencies in lists and validate them in more of a top-down approach, we can also leverage tables in Mardkdown and AsciiDoc to capture dependency links and validation in an easier format to grok. 

[NOTE]
====
Note: If you are looking for help with table formatting in AsciiDoc, check https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#tables. 

Also, note the inline HTML used to define the button below and the anchor for the emphasis text in the table denoting success/failure for requirements testing. It uses the `passthrough` notation in adoc to accomplish this.
