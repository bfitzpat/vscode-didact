## CSS Styling

Currently we are using the CSS template from Bulma - https://bulma.io/ and provide some additions that can be called using curly brackets in the Markdown text for styling...

* `{.didact}` - Changes the cursor for Didact-specific action links to a crosshair instead of a normal link pointer. (Would be great to do this automatically, but this works as a workaround in the short term.)
* `{.imageRight}` - Useful for images we want to float right.
* `{.imageCenter}` - Useful for images we want to be centered in the view.
