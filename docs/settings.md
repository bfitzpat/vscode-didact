## Didact Settings 

To change the default Didact file, access the settings (`File->Preferences->Settings`), type **Didact** and set the `Didact: Default Url`. This can be any valid URL to a Didact formatted Markdown file, including `http://`, `https://`, or `file://` URLs.

To turn on generic Didact completion notifications (off by default), access the settings (`File->Preferences->Settings`), type **Didact** and set the `Didact: Disable Notifications` checkbox. If unchecked, additional notifications will occur when Didact actions are activated in the IDE.

To have Didact open a window with the default Didact file on startup, access the settings (`File->Preferences->Settings`), type **Didact** and set the `Didact: Open Default Tutorial At Startup` checkbox.
