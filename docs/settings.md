## Didact Settings 

The Didact Extension has several configurable settings available. To access the settings, go to (`File->Preferences->Settings`) and type **Didact**.

* To stop automatically recreating the default Didact Tutorials to the view at workspace startup (on by default), set the `Didact: Auto Add Default Tutorials` setting to unchecked.
* To change the default Didact file, set the `Didact: Default Url`. This can be any valid URL to a Didact formatted Markdown file, including `http://`, `https://`, or `file://` URLs.
* To turn on generic Didact completion notifications (off by default), set the `Didact: Disable Notifications` checkbox. If unchecked, additional notifications will occur when Didact actions are activated in the IDE.
* To have Didact open a window with the default Didact file on startup, set the `Didact: Open Default Tutorial At Startup` checkbox.
