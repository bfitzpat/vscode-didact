title: VSCode-Didact - Give Your Readme Superpowers!
description: The **Didact** framework is designed to instruct users in a useful way regarding how to complete tasks through a combination of text (Markdown- or AsciiDoc-formatted), images, and active links that show VS Code functionality in action. Those links are paired with VS Codeâ€™s simple command framework to interact with the IDE directly -- and that provides one-click access to nearly all the functionality VS Code and its extensions have to offer.
