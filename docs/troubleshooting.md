# What do you do if Didact fails to load or fails to load your tutorial?

Biggest Clue? Check the `Output` channels

1. Look at the `Didact Activity` Output channel for any clues as to why a particular Didact link has failed to work. We try to log some diagnostic information in the Didact channel. 
2. Look at the `Log (Extension Host)` Output channel for any clues as to why the Didact extension has failed to load.
