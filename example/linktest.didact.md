# Welcome to Didact!

Didact is an extension for VS Code that provides a simple Markdown-based way to create tutorials that launch VS Code commands and walk users through performing particular tasks. See the [VSCode Didact readme about link formatting for more information](https://github.com/bfitzpat/vscode-didact/blob/master/README.md)!

## Here are some links to Didact files in Github, in the extension itself, and in a workspace location.
