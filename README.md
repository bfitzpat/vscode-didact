# vscode-didact README  

The **vscode-didact** extension does a few things, but mainly it shows what's possible through a combination of a simple Markdown or AsciiDoc file, the VS Code Webview, and calling easily accessible commands in VS Code.

For a demo file of what functionality is currently available, check out [the didact-demo.](vscode://redhat.vscode-didact?https=raw.githubusercontent.com/bfitzpat/vscode-didact/master/demo/didact-demo.didact.md)

## VSCode-Didact In Action

What follows is a simple example with three actions. One scaffolds a project based on a structure defined in JSON. One opens a file created when the folder structure was created. And one triggers a command in a different extension if it's installed. The tutorial is defined in [this MarkDown file](./example/tutorial2.didact.md)

# Implementation Notes

## Accessing Didact in the workspace. 

With Didact installed, there are three ways to open a Didact window.

* To access Didact, access the Command Palette (`View->Command Palette`, `Ctrl+Shift+P`, or `F1`) and type **Didact**. Select `Open Didact` and it will open with the default Didact Markdown file specified in the Settings.
* To open a local Didact file in the workspace directly, Right-click on the Didact Markdown file (`*.didact.md` or `*.didact.adoc`) and select **Start Didact Tutorial from File** from the context menu.

In addition, you now have the `Didact Tutorials` view.

If you right-click on a tutorial (such as "Didact Demo"), you see a `Start Didact Tutorial` menu, which opens the Didact window or changes the current Didact window to the selected tutorial. These entries are provided by registering new tutorial name/tutorial uri/category combinations with Didact's tutorial registry.

### Scaffolding from JSON

You can also access Didact's scaffolding capabilities by right-clicking on a `*.json` file formatted in the way Didact knows and select **Didact Scaffold Project from File**. [See Project JSON Structure](#project-json-structure) below for details about how to construct the project json file.

## Didact Settings 

To change the default Didact file, access the settings (`File->Preferences->Settings`), type **Didact** and set the `Didact: Default Url`. This can be any valid URL to a Didact formatted Markdown file, including `http://`, `https://`, or `file://` URLs.

## CSS Styling

Currently we are using the CSS template from Bulma - https://bulma.io/ and provide some additions that can be called using curly brackets in the Markdown text for styling...

* `{.didact}` - Changes the cursor for Didact-specific action links to a crosshair instead of a normal link pointer. (Would be great to do this automatically, but this works as a workaround in the short term.)
* `{.imageRight}` - Useful for images we want to float right.
* `{.imageCenter}` - Useful for images we want to be centered in the view.

## Didact Link formatting for opening Didact files inside VS Code

Didact now has the ability to open Didact files themselves, which enables us to leverage files that are at public URLs, such as those put into Github repositories as well as those provided in extension source files or even in scaffolded projects. This capability comes in handy if you want to mix and match tutorials and commands, breaking up lengthy processes into smaller chunks.

* You supply https or http links in the format `vscode://redhat.vscode-didact?https=urltofile/file.didact.md` or `vscode://redhat.vscode-didact?http=urltofile/file.didact.md`
* You supply `extension` links in the format `vscode://redhat.vscode-didact?extension=folder/file.didact.md`
* You supply `workspace` links in the format `vscode://redhat.vscode-didact?workspace=folder/file.didact.md`

Within a given Didact tutorial Markdown file, you can then mix and match link styles, opening other tutorials or launching commands with [Didact link formatting](https://github.com/bfitzpat/vscode-didact#link-formatting)

## Didact Link formatting for calling Commands

The Didact webview is listening for link events and responds if a link starts with `didact`. 

Examples:

* `didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.scaffoldProject&srcFilePath='example/project.json'`
* `didact://?commandId='vscode.openFolder'&projectFilePath='simpleGroovyProject/src/simple.groovy'&completion='Opened the simple.groovy file'`
* `didact//?commandId='camelk.startintegration'&projectFilePath='simpleGroovyProject/src/simple.groovy'`

All Didact links have the following qualities:

* Starts with `didact:`
* Then works in pairs
  * `commandId=your.vscode.command.id`
  * (optional) `projectFilePath=my/file/path` (assumes it's in the user's workspace, so has the workspace root prepended)
  * (optional) `srcFilePath=my/src/file/path` (assumes it's in the extension source, so prepends the extension `__dirname`)
  * (optional) `extFilePath=extensionId/my/src/file/path` (assumes the file is exposed by another extension and retrieves it from the installed extension path)
  * (optional) `completion='my%20notification%20message'` (to provide a human readable message to the user upon task completion - note that spaces must be replaced with %20)
  * (optional) `error='my%20error%20message'` (to provide a human readable message to the user upon task error - note that spaces must be replaced with %20)
  * (optional) `text=one$$two$$three` (to provide straight text input to the command, with each argument separated by `$$`) (currently only works out to three arguments, but can likely be expanded further if needed)
  * (optional) `user=one$$two$$three` (to provide user-provided text input to the command, with each argument separated by `$$` -- each string is used as the prompt for the user) (currently only works out to three arguments, but can likely be expanded further if needed)
  * Note: projectFilePath and srcFilePath should be mutually exclusive, but that distinction is not made at present

## Project JSON Structure

The Project JSON file structure is simply a collection of named folders and files, as follows:

```{
    "folders": [
    {
       "name":"simpleGroovyProject",
       "folders": [
         {
             "name":"src",
             "files": [
                 {
                     "name":"simple.groovy",
                     "content":"from('timer:groovy?period=1s')\n\t.routeId('groovy')\n\t.setBody()\n\t.simple('Hello Camel K from ${routeId}')\n\t.to('log:info?showAll=false')\n"
                 },
                 {
                     "name":"mycopied.file",
                     "copy":"file-in-same-directory-as-my-project-json-that-I-want-the-contents-of.txt"
                 }
             ]
           }
     ]
    }
 ]
}
```

Files can either have their content specified in the project json file itself (i.e. `content: "myfilecontent"`) or copy content from a file in the directory at the same level as the project json file (i.e. `copy: myfile.txt`).

## Common Command Ids

* `java.projectConfiguration.update`: Updates a Mavenized Java project, essentially attempting to get it ready to run ([See vscode-java](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java))
* `vscode.didact.createWorkspaceFolder`: Creates a folder in the user's temp directory and adds it to the workspace as a makeshift root directory
* `vscode.didact.extensionRequirementCheck`: Simple check to see if the extension Id is installed in the user workspace. Takes two parameters: the id of the HTML element to update with the results and the extension Id to check for
* `vscode.didact.reload`: Forces the Didact window to reload with the default Didact file specified in VS Code settings
* `vscode.didact.requirementCheck`: Simple command-line check for system capabilities. Takes three parameters - the id of the HTML element to update with the results, the test command (such as `mvn --version`, and a string to search for in the resulting text, such as `Apache Maven` if the mvn command works successfully)
* `vscode.didact.scaffoldProject`: Without an input creates a sample project structure. With an input that is a json file in the format from above, generates the designated folder/file structure.
* `vscode.didact.startDidact`: Opens a Didact window with the Markdown file passed in
* `vscode.didact.startTerminalWithName`: Creates and shows a terminal with the given name in the VS Code window. The name can be omitted.
* `vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString`: Sends text to a named terminal, which is then executed in the terminal. If the named terminal doesn't exist, it is created
* `vscode.didact.workspaceFolderExistsCheck`:  Simple check to see if the workspace has at least one root folder. Takes one parameter: the id of the HTML element to update with the results
* `vscode.openFolder`: [See `Commands` in the VS Code API docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/commands#commands)

# Next steps

1. Find the best way to ensure that files (project.json, commands referencing files in a project scaffolded by a project.json) are accessible across extensions (i.e. if I register a tutorial in Camel K, the Didact extension should be ok with finding all the available commands and any files)
2. Look into finding ways to chain commands together so that you can do things like create a project and open a file all in one go.
3. Look at the Eclipse Cheat sheet approach to see if we can glean anything - http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fextension-points%2FcheatSheetContentFileSpec.html 
4. Also look at the Integr8ly Walkthroughs to see if we can glean anything - https://github.com/integr8ly/tutorial-web-app-walkthroughs/tree/master/walkthroughs
5. Figure out a way to limit the `Start Didact Tutorial from File` context menu to only work for Didact files.
6. Figure out a way to limit the `Didact Scaffold Project from File` context menu to only work for Didact Project Scaffolding files.

**Enjoy!**
